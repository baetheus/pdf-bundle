# PDF Bundle

In one of my college courses the assignments must be submitted as a single
document with a series of pictures and their related captions. Often the
process of creating a word document, embedding and resizing the images, and
ordering them takes as long or longer than the assignments themselves. This
tool is meant to make that process much simpler.

Much thanks to [Andrew Dillon](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib) for pdf-lib
and to [Luca Casonato](https://github.com/lucacasonato/dext.ts) for dext.ts.
This was my first go at using both projects and they made bootstrapping this
tool take a couple hours on a Saturday morning.

## Building

There is a Dockerfile included for [building](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_build/)
this application.

## Support

There is none, but I might have time to read through any issues that pop up.
